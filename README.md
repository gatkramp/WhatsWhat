## Update 28 Jan 2019
Mark Zuckerberg plans to integrate Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp chat. This might be the step needed to implement a standalone simple chatbot. If it will be possible to create a userID through the facebook API and send messages to Whatsapp clients, the complexity of this chatbot will be greatly decreased. This will also eliminate the requirement for a simcard/cell number to chat to whatsapp contacts. Unifying of the 3 platforms could happen as soon as end of 2019 according to [this source](https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/25/facebook-unifying-instagram-whatsapp/).
